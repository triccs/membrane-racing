### üéØ **Learning Algorithm Validation**

#### **Q-Learning Formula**
```
Q(s,a) = Q(s,a) + Œ±[r + Œ≥ max Q(s',a') - Q(s,a)]

Where:
- Œ± (alpha) = 0.1 (learning rate)
- Œ≥ (gamma) = 0.9 (discount factor)
- r = reward value
- Q(s,a) = current Q-value
- max Q(s',a') = maximum Q-value of next state
```

#### **Training Validation**
- **Learning Rate**: 0.1 ensures gradual learning
- **Discount Factor**: 0.9 emphasizes future rewards
- **Value Clamping**: Q-values clamped to [-100, 100]
- **State Transitions**: Proper next-state Q-value lookup

- **Track Adaptation**: Different learning patterns per track type
- **Error Recovery**: Proper handling of invalid inputs
