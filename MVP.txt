The base game is going to contain: 
- car creation and customization
- training 
- track leaderboards 
- track creator (earnings in v2)
- tournaments (v2)

Token
- Weekly maze tracks to earn TOKEN (mining)
- ENERGY covers payments (CDT used for tournies, TOKEN burned)
- All PvP training and tournament winnings r in CDT (Tournament)
- PvP training cost gets split to other cars used in training (will have to mesh this with energy and may get removed)
- Training in TAB? Helps distribution and could be added to their desktop
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TODO:
- I want to save Track rankings in the Track Manager state
- Track a car's training per track_id {solo: tally, win_rate, fastest, pvp: tally, win_rate, fastest}

- Solo ENERGY (Daily regen or pay for regen)
- PvP ENERGY (No daily regen but starts at 100)

PvP:
- (RNG component for variance in simulations)
- Slipstream 
-- With slipstreaming we can use "Spawn zones" (for the starting area) bc the boost creates fairness
- Blocking mech  (car with higher Q-value on same blcok mvement wins, other doesnt move)
- Shove mech (same tile collision but car with lower momentum gets knocked in the direction of movement)

PvP Rewards:
- blocking Rewards
- positional advantage Rewards
- boost tile landing

(-) All starting tiles need the same distance from the finish (PvP) (Eh nvm we'll see if slipstream saves it)

Auto-Battling:
- You can opt into tournaments and PvPs on any list of track_ids. Paid for tourney wins or PvP training use. Each tourney needs a new entry fee but players can toggle to purchase a new one with their unclaimed earnings.

GAME:
- Within the track selector, there will be an option to join the tournament. If the car has already bought a tourney voucher there is no entry fee. This allows tournaments to be autonomous as long as there are at least 8 cars opted-in.
- Showcase top cars on leaderboards (gives space for cosmetic packs)
- Swap to AI vision to show only the state the state hash can see

IF THEY WANT TO SPECULATE, LET THEM:
- betting on races & weekly mazes (?)

FUTURE:
- Mazes? (recursive backtracking algo)
- Flappy Bird
- turnbased combat (earn skills/weapons to learn how to use) 
-- (if not turn-based it can be simulatneous RPS)
-- we will use a separate Q-table for new actions: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-688d48664ba88191ae3ac25f57d61714-q-racing/c/68913d39-a810-8326-a5f6-0e4455e7f25c
- MINING or use completed mazes as mining
- CTF

 - DeFi tamagachi (this doesn't really use movement or combat tho so may be a separate Q-table)

- Ability to Simulate races across multiple msgs (Gas split for large sims)
