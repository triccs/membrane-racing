The base game is going to contain: 
- car creation and customization
- training 
- track leaderboards 
- track creator (earnings in v2)
- tournaments



TODO:
- I want to save Track rankings in the Track Manager state


PvP:

- Slipstream 
-- With slipstreaming we can use "Spawn zones" (for the starting area) bc the boost creates fairness
- Blocking mech  (car with higher Q-value on same blcok mvement wins, other doesnt move)
- Shove mech (same tile collision but car with lower momentum gets knocked in the direction of movement)

PvP Rewards:
- blocking Rewards
- positional advantage Rewards
- boost tile landing



(-) All starting tiles need the same distance from the finish (PvP) (Eh nvm we'll see if slipstream saves it)



FUTURE:
- Mazes? (recursive backtracking algo)
- Flappy Bird
- turnbased combat (earn skills/weapons to learn how to use) 
-- (if not turn-based it can be simulatneous RPS)
-- we will use a separate Q-table for new actions: https://chatgpt.com/g/g-688d48664ba88191ae3ac25f57d61714-q-racing/c/68913d39-a810-8326-a5f6-0e4455e7f25c
